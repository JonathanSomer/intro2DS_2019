# Introduction to Data Science

## python refresher materials

python resources
python is an extremely popular open source high level general purpose programming language.
there are many online resources for learning python. Most of which teach python from the perspective of the software engineer, teaching various use cases such as web development, ETL processes, etc.
for our purposes it is better to focus on material that tech python from the Data Science perspective (gathering and loading data, manipulating data, visualizations, ML, DL etc.)
following is a short list of good materials, some completely free, and others provide some kind of trial period. You are encouraged to search the web for additional resources.
